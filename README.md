# RoadQuality

Tired of the bad roads? This app is a simple way to fix it. RoadQuality uses your phone's accelerometer and GPS to detect the severity and location of poor road conditions. With this crowdsourced data, we can direct transportation agencies to the roads that need repair the most.

## Progress

This app is still very much a work in progress, but this is what is implemented so far:
- [X] Detects and records bumps with accelerometer
- [X] Records location with GPS
- [X] Interpolates GPS data to find coordinates of bumps
- [X] Able to record individual trips
- [X] Runs as a foreground service (Independent of the app)
- [X] Implements Material Design and fluid animations
- [X] View past trips on a map

And this is what still needs to be added in the future:
- [ ] Automatically start recording when connected to Bluetooth device or navigating with Google Maps
- [ ] Upload anonymous data to a cloud server
