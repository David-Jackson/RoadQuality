    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for the
      <unl>Road Quality Android app</unl>. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this app. It will notify
      you of the following:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website, how it is used and with whom it
        may be shared.</li>
      <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.</li>
      <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
      <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</strong>
      <br> We are the sole owners of the information collected on this app. We only have access to/collect information that
      you voluntarily give us through the app. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone. However, we do reserve
      the right to sell non-identifying analytics and data based on this information</p>
    <p>Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via the app in the future to tell you about new products or services, or
      changes to this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Your Access to and Control Over Information</strong>
      <br> You have complete control of your data while it remains on your device. After you upload data anonymously to our
      servers, that data is no longer under your control. You may express any concern you have about our use of your data
      at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number given on our website.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Security</strong>
      <br> We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the app, your information
      is protected both online and offline.</p>
    <p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as location data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us
      in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning
      of the address of the Web page.</p>
    <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline.
      Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted
      access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information
      are kept in a secure environment.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sharing</strong>
      <br>
      We share aggregated demographic information with our partners. This
      is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at 
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">517-917-0285</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">via email</span>.
